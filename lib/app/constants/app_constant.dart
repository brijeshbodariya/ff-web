  static String ford = """Ford - The Deep Sea Warrior
Role: Tank / Survivor
Skill: Iron Will (Passive Skill)

Backstory:
Ford is a former naval officer, toughened by years of experience in harsh environments. He is a man of few words, but his resolve is unbreakable. Ford’s naval background has prepared him to endure extreme conditions, making him one of the toughest characters in Diamond. His ability to withstand the effects of the shrinking safe zone is what sets him apart from other characters, allowing him to survive longer outside the safe zone.

Ford’s cool-headed nature and strategic mindset were honed during his time at sea, where every decision was a matter of life and death. He now uses those skills in battle, staying calm under pressure and always thinking ahead. Ford’s endurance and resilience make him a valuable asset in long-lasting fights, especially when positioning near the edge of the safe zone becomes a tactical advantage.

Special Ability: Iron Will
Ford’s Iron Will is a passive ability that reduces the damage he takes when outside the safe zone. This skill gives Ford the unique advantage of being able to survive longer in hazardous areas, making him ideal for players who like to push their luck and loot outside the safe zone or engage in fights near its edge.

Skill Details:
At the base level, Iron Will reduces damage taken outside the safe zone by 4%.
As the skill levels up, the damage reduction increases, reaching up to 24% at the maximum level.
This allows Ford to play closer to the danger zone and take calculated risks, looting or flanking enemies while others are rushing to stay inside the safe area.
Appearance:
Ford’s appearance reflects his naval background. He wears a rugged, military-style outfit with navy insignia, showcasing his experience as a seasoned officer. His look is practical, with heavy-duty boots, cargo pants, and a vest, designed for survival in the toughest conditions. Ford’s stern face and battle-hardened demeanor give him the aura of a warrior who is always prepared for a fight.

His overall appearance makes him stand out as a determined and tough character, ready to face whatever challenges the battlefield throws his way.

Playstyle Tips:

Ford is perfect for players who want to take advantage of the shrinking safe zone to play more aggressively near its edge. His Iron Will allows him to stay outside the safe zone longer than most characters, giving you more time to loot or set up ambushes.
Use Ford’s ability to survive in the danger zone to flank enemies or grab high-value loot in areas other players may avoid due to the shrinking circle.
If you’re in a squad, Ford can be the one to stay behind and loot or delay enemies while your teammates move ahead into the safe zone. His damage reduction gives him extra time to complete these tasks without getting knocked down by the shrinking zone.
Pair Ford with healing characters or items that can help him last even longer outside the safe zone, further enhancing his ability to withstand damage and survive until the final stages of the game.
Strengths:
Ford’s Iron Will is excellent for players who like to take calculated risks near the edge of the safe zone or are often caught in the shrinking zone.
His skill gives him an advantage in long matches where the safe zone becomes more dangerous, allowing him to survive in places where other characters would quickly be eliminated.
He’s a great choice for tactical players who enjoy positioning and controlling space around the safe zone.
Weaknesses:
Ford’s ability is situational and only activates when he is outside the safe zone, meaning it doesn’t offer direct combat advantages like enhanced damage or mobility.
Players who always stay inside the safe zone may not find Ford’s skill as useful, as it doesn’t contribute to firefights or combat scenarios directly.
His skill doesn’t affect gunfights or defense in battles, so players who prefer aggressive combat might prefer characters with more offensive or mobility-oriented abilities.

  static String nikita = """Nikita - The Bodyguard
Role: Support / Gunplay Specialist
Skill: Firearms Expert (Passive Skill)

Backstory:
Nikita is a professional bodyguard with a specialty in firearms handling. Her main task was to protect a famous celebrity from constant threats, but her skills extend far beyond just defense. Nikita’s expertise with firearms, especially submachine guns (SMGs), makes her a deadly force in combat, and her loyalty to her duties drives her to be one of the best in the business.

Trained in close-quarters combat and high-stakes protection, Nikita is quick, efficient, and always ready to protect those under her care. Despite her seemingly cool exterior, she takes her role very seriously, and her dedication to her craft makes her a fierce competitor in the battlefield. Whether it’s protecting VIPs or outgunning enemies, Nikita’s focus and proficiency with firearms make her a valuable ally.

Special Ability: Firearms Expert

At the base level, Firearms Expert grants a 4% faster reload speed for SMGs.
As the skill levels up, the reload speed bonus increases, with a maximum of 24% faster reload at the highest level.
This makes Nikita a great character for players who prefer fast-paced, close-range combat with SMGs, as she can quickly get back into the fight after reloading.
Appearance:
Nikita’s appearance reflects her background as a professional bodyguard. She is dressed in tactical clothing, designed for agility and practicality. Her look includes a protective vest, fingerless gloves, and cargo pants, making her ready for action at any moment. Her hair is short, further emphasizing her no-nonsense attitude and focus on efficiency.

With her sharp eyes and determined expression, Nikita carries the presence of someone who is always alert and ready to react. Her overall appearance gives off a sense of professionalism and expertise, befitting someone in her line of work.

Playstyle Tips:

Nikita is perfect for players who love using SMGs and prefer to be in the middle of fast-paced, close-range firefights. Her faster reload speed allows you to keep up the pressure on enemies without being slowed down by long reload times.
Equip Nikita with your favorite SMGs to maximize her ability. Guns like the MP5, UMP, or Vector work especially well with her skill, letting you shred through enemies at close range while reloading faster than usual.
Her Firearms Expert skill is passive, meaning it doesn’t require activation. This allows you to play aggressively without worrying about timing her ability.
In squad play, Nikita can excel as a support character, providing cover fire and quick eliminations while other teammates heal or reposition.
Strengths:
Nikita’s Firearms Expert makes her one of the best characters for SMG users, significantly boosting her reload speed and letting her maintain constant pressure in close combat.
Her skill is simple and effective, making her a great choice for beginners or players who want a passive advantage without needing to manage complicated abilities.
She works well in squad settings where aggressive flanking or rushing tactics are employed, allowing her to clear rooms or push enemies efficiently.
Weaknesses:
Nikita’s skill is only beneficial when using SMGs, meaning players who prefer rifles, shotguns, or sniper rifles won’t get much out of her ability.
Her reload speed boost doesn’t directly improve damage or movement, so players who rely on raw firepower or mobility might prefer other characters with more combat-enhancing abilities.
Players who prefer to engage in long-range combat may not find Nikita’s skill useful, as SMGs are best suited for close-range battles.

Her skill does not improve gunplay or survivability outside of vehicles, so players must make vehicles a priority to maximize her potential.
